# Yakuza: Like a Dragon Randomizer
A modification for Yakuza: Like A Dragon (A.K.A Yakuza 7) that randomizes enemies and skills. Scales enemies accordingly throughout the game.

# A Warning on Stability:
This version (0.1.4) is mostly stable, every fight in the game should be completable.
If your game crashes, softlocks, etc. when trying to fight a specific enemy or use a specific skill, then my best suggestion would be to let me know on either 
the Yakuza Modding Discord Mod-Feedback or leave a reply on the mod page detailing what enemy you were trying to fight or what skill you were trying to use, 
and if possible inlcude your modified Randomizer mod folder. After sending me feedback then regenerate your enemies/skills as this should
randomize the enemy/skill that was causing issues away (hopefully for the rest of your playthrough).

# How to use (Ryu Mod Manager):
 ## Step 1:
  
  Download the Randomizer.exe file. This will generate an RMM compatible mod folder with the randomized enemy file.
  
 ## Step 2:
  
  Simply run Randomizer.exe, and once it is completed drag the generated "[Enemy/Skill] Randomizer" folder into your mods folder (located in your game files)
 
 ## Step 3:
  You have now successfully randomized your enemies/skills in Yakuza: Like A Dragon. Nothing else is required and enjoy! If you'd like to randomize your
  enemies/skills again its just as simple as rerunning and Randomizer.exe file and replacing the one in your mods folder with the new one.

# How to use (Manual Installation):
 ## Step 1:
  
  Download the Randomizer.exe file. This will generate an RMM compatible mod folder with the randomized enemy file.
  
 ## Step 2:
  
  Simply run Randomizer.exe, and once it is completed you will need to put the generated character_npc_soldier_personal_data.bin or rpg_skill.bin file
  into the unpacked db.yazawa.par folder (corresponding language) and then repack again. 
  
## Step 3:
  Once completed put this newly packaged db.yazawa.par into your YLAD files, replacing the already
  existing db.yazawa.par (again corresponding language)
 
 ## Step 4:
  You have now successfully randomized your enemies/skills in Yakuza: Like A Dragon. Nothing else is required and enjoy! If you'd like to randomize your
  enemies/skills again its just as simple as rerunning and Randomizer.exe file and following the same process of repacking your par folder and replacing
  your corresponding db.yazawa.par in your YLAD files.
