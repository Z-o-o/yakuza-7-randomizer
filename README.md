# Yakuza: Like a Dragon Enemy Randomizer
A modification for Yakuza: Like A Dragon (A.K.A Yakuza 7) that randomizes enemies and scales them accordingly throughout the game.

# A Warning on Stability:
This version (0.1.0) is still quite buggy and not every enemy has been tested to see where they break the game.
If your game crashes, softlocks, etc. when trying to fight a specific enemy, then my best suggestion would be to let me know on either 
the Yakuza Modding Discord Mod-Feedback or leave a reply on the mod page detailing what enemy you were trying to fight, and if possible
inlcude your modified character_npc_soldier_personal_data.bin file. After sending me feedback 1st regenerate your enemies as this should
randomize the enemy that was causing issues away (hopefully for the rest of your playthrough).

# How to use:
 ## Step 1:
  
  Download the Randomizer.exe file. This will generate an RMM compatible mod folder with the randomized enemy file.
  
 ## Step 2:
  
  Simply run Randomizer.exe, and once it is completed drag the generated "Randomizer" folder into your mods folder
 
 ## Step 3:
  You have now successfully randomized your enemies in Yakuza: Like A Dragon. Nothing else is required and enjoy! If you'd like to randomize your
  enemies again its just as simple as rerunning and Randomizer.exe file and replacing the one in your mods folder with the new one.
